# Code Review: `eat` Function

Let's review your `eat` function for correctness and edge case handling.

## 1. **Logic for Main Cases**

- If `need <= remaining`, the rabbit eats exactly what it needs, and the remaining carrots are reduced by `need`.
- If `need > remaining`, the rabbit eats all remaining carrots, and the remaining count becomes zero.
- The function returns `[total_eaten, carrots_left]`.


## 2. **Example Outputs**

Let's check the provided examples:

- `eat(5, 6, 10)` → `[^11][^4]` (5 + 6 = 11, 10 - 6 = 4)
- `eat(4, 8, 9)` → `[^12][^1]` (4 + 8 = 12, 9 - 8 = 1)
- `eat(1, 10, 10)` → `[^11][^0]` (1 + 10 = 11, 10 - 10 = 0)
- `eat(2, 11, 5)` → `[^7][^0]` (2 + 5 = 7, 0 left)
All outputs match the expected results.


## 3. **Edge Case Analysis**

Let's consider the edge cases:

- **`need = 0`**: The rabbit doesn't need to eat more. The function should return `[number, remaining]`.
    - Example: `eat(3, 0, 7)` → `[^3][^7]` (correct)
- **`remaining = 0`**: No carrots left. The rabbit can't eat more, so total eaten stays the same, remaining is 0.
    - Example: `eat(3, 5, 0)` → `[^3][^0]` (correct)
- **`number = 0`**: Rabbit hasn't eaten any yet. The function should still work.
    - Example: `eat(0, 5, 10)` → `[^5][^5]` (correct)
- **All zeroes**: `eat(0, 0, 0)` → `[^0][^0]` (correct)
- **Negative values**: The function does not handle negative inputs, but the constraints specify all inputs are non-negative, so this is fine.


## 4. **Constraints**

- All inputs are between 0 and 1000, so no need for additional input validation.


## 5. **Conclusion**

- **No logic errors found.**
- **All edge cases are handled correctly.**
- **Outputs match all examples.**


### Quick Summary

- The function is correct and robust for all specified cases.
- For further confidence, you can add unit tests for the edge cases above.
