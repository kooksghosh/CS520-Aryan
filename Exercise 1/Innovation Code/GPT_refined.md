Your implementation is **correct** for the stated problem and constraints.

### Why it’s correct

* You eat at most `need`, but never more than `remaining`:

  ```python
  eaten_now = min(need, remaining)
  ```
* Totals and leftovers are updated consistently:

  * `total = number + eaten_now`
  * `left  = remaining - eaten_now` (never negative)
* It returns a **list** `[total, left]`, matching the spec and examples.

### Edge cases

* `need = 0` → `eaten_now = 0` ⇒ returns `[number, remaining]` (no change). ✅
* `remaining = 0` → `eaten_now = 0` ⇒ returns `[number, 0]`. ✅
* `number = 0` works naturally. ✅
* All provided examples evaluate correctly:

  * `eat(5,6,10) = [11,4]`
  * `eat(4,8,9)  = [12,1]`
  * `eat(1,10,10)= [11,0]`
  * `eat(2,11,5) = [7,0]`

### Optional (not required) niceties

If you want to enforce the non-negative integer constraints explicitly, you could add a guard:

```python
def eat(number, need, remaining):
    if any(not isinstance(x, int) or x < 0 for x in (number, need, remaining)):
        raise ValueError("number, need, remaining must be non-negative integers")
    eaten_now = min(need, remaining)
    return [number + eaten_now, remaining - eaten_now]
```

But as written, your function already meets the requirements and handles the edge cases properly.
